My First R Markdown File
==============================

This is my first R markdown file

Here we're going load some data

``` {r}
library(datasets)
data("airquality")
summary(airquality)
```


Let's first make a pairs plot of the data


```{r}
pairs(airquality)
```


Here's a regression model of Ozone on wind, solar radiation, and temperature


``` {r}
library(stats)
fit <- lm(Ozone ~ Wind + Solar.R + Temp, data = airquality)
summary(fit)

```

Here's an unordered list

* First
* Second


I don't want code to be echoed

``` {r simulation, echo=FALSE}
set.seed(1)
x <- rnorm(100)
mean(x)
```


I want the code only to show and not the result
``` {r simulation2, results="hide"}
set.seed(1)
x <- rnorm(100)
mean(x)
```
